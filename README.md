# Agent Onboarding Protocol

An open standard for declaring what vendors need from enterprise environments before rollout.

## Install

```bash
npx skills add interf-labs/agent-onboarding-protocol
```

Then tell your coding agent:

```
declare an onboarding contract for this project and preview rollout for BlackRock
```

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `interf-declare` | Declare an `interf.yaml` onboarding contract |
| `interf-preview` | Preview enterprise rollout against a company profile |
| `agent-onboarding-protocol` | Protocol spec + canonical dependency types (loaded automatically) |

## The Contract

```yaml
name: crm-automation
version: 0.2.0
description: Automates CRM data entry and follow-up scheduling

requirements:
  - what: Read/write access to your CRM (contacts and opportunities)
    ready: We can create a contact and read an opportunity via API from staging
    canonical: integration.crm.api

  - what: SSO endpoint for our service to authenticate your users
    ready: A test user can log into our app via your SSO
    canonical: auth.sso.saml

  - what: Security review and approval for our integration
    ready: Security review completed and vendor approved
    canonical: process.security-review

optional:
  - what: Webhook endpoint for real-time updates
    ready: We receive a test webhook within 5 seconds of a CRM update
    canonical: integration.webhook.outbound
```
