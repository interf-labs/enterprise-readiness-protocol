# CRM API Access

Read/write access to enterprise CRM system via API. One of the most common dependencies — almost any customer-facing automation needs CRM access.

## Template

- **what:** Read/write access to your CRM (contacts and opportunities)
- **ready:** We can create a contact and read an opportunity via API from our staging environment

## Matches

Use this type when vendor says: "access to your CRM", "read/write contacts", "opportunity data", "customer records", "Salesforce/HubSpot access"

## System-Specific

- [Salesforce](./systems/salesforce.md) — Connected App, OAuth scopes, IP allowlisting
- [HubSpot](./systems/hubspot.md) — Private App, rate limits, association API

## Sector Patterns

- [Financial Services](./sectors/financial-services.md) — PII restrictions, extended security review
- [Healthcare](./sectors/healthcare.md) — HIPAA BAA, PHI handling, de-identification

# CRM Bulk Export

`integration.crm.bulk-export`

One-time or periodic bulk export of CRM data. Different from API access — this is batch data transfer for training models or backfilling.

## Template

- **what:** Bulk export of CRM records (contacts and opportunities, 12+ months)
- **ready:** We receive a data export of 12+ months of records in CSV or via bulk API

## Use Cases

- [CRM automation at a Fortune 500 bank](./use-cases/crm-automation-at-bank.md) — Salesforce, financial services, 5-week security review
